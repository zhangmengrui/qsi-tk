  abstract = {The optical performance of a parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) is studied comprehensively based on Monte Carlo Ray Tracing method (MCRT) and theoretical analysis. The MCRT models are established, and the theoretical equations of several critical parameters are derived firstly. And then the effects of different geometrical parameters on the optical performance are discussed in detail. It is revealed that the distribution of local concentration ratio around the absorber tube changes greatly, and cannot be divided into four parts as previous studies showed for some special parameter conditions. The theoretically derived parameters explain very well the different properties for the critical conditions. The variations of those parameters with different geometrical configurations are further displayed. Accordingly, the optical properties for different critical parameters are discussed. The size relationship between the reflected light cone and the absorber diameter affects the optical efficiency significantly because of the rays escaping effect. Practically, the absorber diameter should be larger than the size of the reflected light cone to avoid great optical loss caused by rays escaping. All the findings in this paper establish the foundation for further research on the optical-to-thermal energy conversion in the PTC system, and provide a reference for designing and optimizing PTC’s structure.}

  abstract = {{Therapeutic carbon ion beams produce a complex and variable radiation field that changes along the penetration depth due to the high density of energy loss along the particle track together with the secondary particles produced by nuclear fragmentation reactions. An accurate physical characterisation of such complex mixed-radiation fields can be performed by measuring microdosimetric spectra with mini tissue-equivalent proportional counters (mini-TEPCs), which are one of the most accurate devices used in experimental microdosimetry. Numerical calculations with Monte Carlo codes such as FLUKA can be used to supplement experimental microdosimetric measurements performed with TEPCs, but the nuclear cross sections and fragmentation models need to be benchmarked with experimental data for different energies and scenarios. The aim of this work is to compare experimental carbon microdosimetric data measured with the mini TEPC with calculated microdosimetry spectra obtained with FLUKA for 12C ions of 189.5 MeV/u in the Bragg peak region.}},

In the ICRP methodology, the cumulated absorbed dose in the kidneys is estimated by multiplying the administered activity with the corresponding given dose coefficients. The other methods were based on Monte Carlo simulations performed on two paediatric voxel phantoms (CHILD and BABY), and another three phantoms, which were modified to suit the mass of the patients’ kidneys, and other anatomical factors. Different S-values were estimated using this methodology, which together with solving the ICRP biokinetic model to determine the cumulated activities, allowed for the estimation of absorbed doses different from those obtained with the ICRP method, together with new dose coefficients. The obtained values were then compared. The deviations suggest that the S-values are strongly dependent on the patient's total body weight, which could be in contrast with the ICRP data, which is provided by age, regardless of other anatomical parameters.}},

The data used in the validation and verification of the model is a real case study that increases the practical application of the proposed model. The results show that a slight increase in collected blood units will lead to a noticeable increase in minimum and average availability percentage accompanied by an acceptable increase in the total BSC cost, taking into consideration the effect of cost parameters on total cost behavior.}

  abstract  = {The colossal solution spaces of most configurable systems make intractable their exhaustive exploration. Accordingly, relevant analyses remain open research problems. There exist analyses alternatives such as SAT solving or constraint programming. However, none of them have explored simulation-based methods. Monte Carlo-based decision making is a simulation-based method for dealing with colossal solution spaces using randomness. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that tackles various of those analyses using Monte Carlo methods, which have proven to succeed in vast search spaces (e.g., game theory). Our general framework is described formally, and its flexibility to cope with a diversity of analysis problems is discussed (e.g., finding defective configurations, feature model reverse engineering or getting optimal performance configurations). Additionally, we present a Python implementation of the framework that shows the feasibility of our proposal. With this contribution, we envision that different problems can be addressed using Monte Carlo simulations and that our framework can be used to advance the state of the art a step forward.},

  abstract = {We consider time-space tradeoffs for static data structure problems in the cell probe model with word size 1 (the bit probe model). In this model, the goal is to represent n-bit data with s=n+r bits such that queries (of a certain type) about the data can be answered by reading at most t bits of the representation. Ideally, we would like to keep both s and t small, but there are tradeoffs between the values of s and t that limit the possibilities of keeping both parameters small. In this paper, we consider the case of succinct representations, where s=n+r for some redundancy r≪n. For a Boolean version of the problem of polynomial evaluation with preprocessing of coefficients, we show a lower bound on the redundancy-query time tradeoff of the form (r+1)t≥Ω(n/logn). In particular, for very small redundancies r, we get an almost optimal lower bound stating that the query algorithm has to inspect almost the entire data structure (up to a logarithmic factor). We show similar lower bounds for problems satisfying a certain combinatorial properties of a coding theoretic flavor, and obtain (r+1)t≥Ω(n) for certain problems. Previously, no ω(m) lower bounds were known on t in the general model for explicit Boolean problems, even for very small redundancies. By restricting our attention to systematic or index structures ϕ satisfying ϕ(x)=x⋅ϕ*(x) for some map ϕ∗ (where ⋅ denotes concatenation), we show similar lower bounds on the redundancy-query time tradeoff for the natural data structuring problems of Prefix Sum and Substring Search.}

He claimed that this “Law of Abbreviation” is a universal structural property of language. The Law of Abbreviation has since been documented in a wide range of human languages, and extended to animal communication systems and even computer programming languages. Zipf hypothesised that this universal design feature arises as a result of individuals optimising form-meaning mappings under competing pressures to communicate accurately but also efficiently—his famous Principle of Least Effort. In this study, we use a miniature artificial language learning paradigm to provide direct experimental evidence for this explanatory hypothesis. We show that language users optimise form-meaning mappings only when pressures for accuracy and efficiency both operate during a communicative task, supporting Zipf's conjecture that the Principle of Least Effort can explain this universal feature of word length distributions.}

We develop statistical tools for the detection of frauds in customs declarations that rely on the Newcomb-Benford law for significant digits. Our first contribution is to show the features, in the context of a European Union market, of the traders for which the law should hold in the absence of fraudulent data manipulation. Our results shed light on a relevant and debated question, since no general known theory can exactly predict validity of the law for genuine empirical data. We also provide approximations to the distribution of test statistics when the Newcomb-Benford law does not hold. These approximations open the door to the development of modified goodness-of-fit procedures with wide applicability and good inferential properties.}
